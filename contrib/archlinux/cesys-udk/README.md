PKGBUILD for cesys-udk
======================

This PKGBUILD will create an archlinux package containing the UDK libraries,
firmware and utility scripts. You need this before installing beastlink.
Please note that this PKGBUILD only packages the USB interface library for EFM
boards as this is the only one publicly accessible (hence the `-lite` suffix).
